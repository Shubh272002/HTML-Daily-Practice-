    <p>Shastri was born to <a href="#">Sharad Prasad Srivastava</a> and <a href="#">Ramdulari Devi</a>  in Mughalsarai on 2 October 1904. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi, he joined the  <mark>Indian Independence movement in the 1920s</mark>. He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in the Indian National Congress. <mark>Following independence in 1947</mark>, he joined the Indian government and became one of Prime Minister Nehru's key cabinet colleagues, first as Railways Minister (1951–56), and then in numerous other prominent positions, including the Home Minister.

        As prime minister, Shastri promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board. Underlining the need to boost India's food production, Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution in India <mark>in 1965</mark>. This led to an increase in food grain production, especially in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. He led the country during the Second India–Pakistan War. His slogan <a href="#">"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan"</a> ("Hail to the soldier; Hail to the farmer") became very popular during the war. The war formally ended with the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January 1966; Shastri died the next day.
        
        Early years <a href="#">(1904–1920)</a>
        Shastri was born on <a href="#">2 October 1904</a> at the home of his maternal grandparents in a North-Indian Kayastha Hindu family.[1] Shastri's paternal ancestors were in the service of the zamindar of Ramnagar near Banaras, and Shastri lived there for the first year of his life. Shastri's father, Sharad Prasad Srivastava, was a school teacher who later became a clerk in the revenue office at Prayagraj, while his mother, Ramdulari Devi, was the daughter of Munshi Hazari Lal, the headmaster and English teacher at a railway school in <mark>Mughalsarai</mark> . Shastri was the second child and eldest son of his parents; he had an elder sister, Kailashi Devi (b. 1900).[2][3]
        
        In <a href="#">April 1906</a>, when Shastri was hardly <mark>18 months old</mark>, his father, who had only recently been promoted to the post of deputy tahsildar, died in an epidemic of bubonic plague. Ramdulari Devi, then only <a href="#">23 years</a> old and pregnant with her third child, took her two children and moved from Ramnagar to her father's house in Mughalsarai and settled there for good. She gave birth to a daughter, Sundari Devi, in <a href="#">July 1906</a>.[4][5] Thus, Shastri and his sisters grew up in the household of his maternal grandfather, Hazari Lalji.[6] However, Hazari Lalji himself died from a stroke in <a href="#">mid-1908</a>. Thereafter, the family was looked after by his brother (Shastri's great-uncle) Darbari Lal, who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department at Ghazipur, and later by his son (Ramdulari Devi's cousin) Bindeshwari Prasad, a school teacher in <a href="#">Mughalsarai</a>.[7]
        
        This situation was fairly standard for the time, where the Indian joint family system was a thriving reality; the sense of family relationship and responsibility it fostered was the primary social security of the time. Nor should it be surmised from these circumstances that Shastri grew up in an under-privileged manner, or that his education and comforts were compromised. On the contrary, since he was a rank student, he received a better education than some of his cousins.[8] Bindeshwari Prasad, on the limited salary of a school teacher, with many dependents, nevertheless managed to give a good education to all the children in his care.
        
        In 1917, Bindeshwari Prasad was transferred to Varanasi, and the entire family moved there, including Ramdulari Devi and her three children. In Varanasi, Shastri joining the seventh standard at <a href="#">Harish Chandra High School</a>.

    <p><b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b> <a href="#">( 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964)</a><i></i> was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular humanist, social democrat,[2] author and statesman who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century. Nehru was second only to Mahatma Gandhi in leading the Indian nationalist movement in the <b>1930s and 1940s.</b> Upon <b>India's independence</b> from <b>Britain in 1947</b>, he served as the country's 
        first <mark>prime minister for 16 years</mark>.[3] Nehru championed parliamentary democracy, secularism, science and technology during the <b>1950s</b>, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he is well-known as one of the Founders of the Non-aligned Movement and, concomitantly, for steering India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A coveted author,
         the books he wrote in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His <mark>Daughter (1929)</mark>, An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of <b>India (1946)</b>, have been read and deliberated upon around the world.

        The son of <b> Motilal Nehru</b>, a prominent <mark>lawyer and Indian nationalist</mark>, <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b> was educated in England—at Harrow School and <b>Trinity College</b>, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and soon began to take an interest in national politics, 
        which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the <u><mark>Indian National Congress</mark></u>, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the <u>1920s</u>, and eventually of the <b>Congress</b> in its totality, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As <a href="#">Congress president in 1929</a>, Nehru called for complete independence from the <i>British Raj</i>.
        
        Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the <i>1930s</i>. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the <u>1937 provincial elections</u>, allowing the <b>Congress</b> to sweep the elections, and to form governments in several provinces. In <b>September 1939</b>, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without consulting them. 
        After the All <a href="#">India Congress Committee's</a> Quit India Resolution of <a href="#">8 August 1942</a> senior Congress leaders were imprisoned and for a time the organisation was suppressed. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. 
        The Muslim League, under <mark>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</mark>, had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections but the League won most seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. <b>Nehru</b> became the interim prime minister of India in <mark>September 1946</mark>, with the League joining his government with some hesitancy in <u>October 1946</u>.

    <p>
        <b>Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi Indira Nehru </b><i>(19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984)</i>
         was an Indian politician and stateswoman who was Prime Minister of India from  <mark>1966 to 1977 </mark>and again from 1980 until
          her assassination in <mark> 1984</mark>. She was India's first and, to date, only female prime minister, and a central figure in
           Indian politics as the leader of the Indian National Congress (INC). She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the 
           first prime minister of India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her in office as the country's sixth
            prime minister. Gandhi's cumulative tenure of <u>15 years and 350 days </u>makes her the second-longest-serving Indian
             prime minister after her father. 
        Henry Kissinger described her as an "Iron Lady", a nickname that became associated with her tough personality.
During Nehru's premiership from <mark>1947 to 1964</mark>, Gandhi was his hostess and accompanied him on his numerous foreign trips. 
In 1959, she played a part in the dissolution of the communist-led Kerala state government as then-president of the Indian
 National Congress, otherwise a ceremonial position to which she was elected earlier that year. Lal Bahadur Shastri, who 
 had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his <b> death in 1964</b>, appointed her minister of information and broadcasting in 
 his government; the same year she was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.
  After Shastri's sudden death in January 1966, Gandhi defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, in the INC's parliamentary 
  leadership election to become leader and also succeeded Shastri as prime minister. She led the Congress to victory in 
  two subsequent elections, starting with the 1967 general election, in which she was first elected to the lower house
   of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha. In <i>1971</i>, her party secured its first landslide victory since her father's 
   sweep in 1962, focusing on issues such as poverty. But following the nationwide state of emergency she implemented,
    she faced massive anti-incumbency sentiment causing the INC to lose the <b>1977 election</b>, the first time in the history 
    of India to happen so. She even lost her own parliamentary constituency. However, due to her portrayal as a strong
     leader and the weak governance of the <mark>Janata Party</mark>, her party won the next election by landslide with her return to 
     the premiership. <br><br>
     As prime minister, Gandhi was known for her uncompromising political stances and centralization of power within the 
     executive branch. In 1967, she headed a military conflict with China in which India repelled Chinese incursions into
      the Himalayas.[2] In 1971, she went to war with Pakistan in support of the independence movement and war of 
      independence in East Pakistan, which resulted in an Indian victory and the <b>independence of Bangladesh</b>, as well 
      as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the sole regional power in South Asia.[3] She played 
      a crucial role in initiating India's first successful nuclear weapon test in <mark>1974</mark>. Her rule saw India grow closer 
      to the Soviet Union by signing a friendship treaty in 1971, with India receiving military, financial, and diplomatic
      support from the Soviet Union during its conflict with Pakistan in the same year.[4] Though India was at the 
    forefront of the non-aligned movement, Gandhi made it one of the Soviet Union's closest allies in Asia, each often
    supporting the other in proxy wars and at the United Nations.[5] Responding to separatist tendencies and a call
     for revolution, she instituted a state of emergency from <b>1974</b>, during which she ruled by decree and basic
     civil liberties were suspended.[6] More than <b>100,000 political opponents</b>, journalists and dissenters were 
     imprisoned.[6] She faced the growing Sikh separatism movement throughout her fourth premiership; in response, 
     she ordered Operation Blue Star, which involved military action in the Golden Temple and killed hundreds of Sikhs.
     On 31 October 1984, she was assassinated by two of her bodyguards, 
     both of whom were Sikh nationalists seeking retribution for the <u>events at the temple</u>.

        <b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</b> (25 December 1924 – 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician and poet who was 
        Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from <b>1998 to 1999</b>, 
        followed by a full term from <mark>1999 to 2004</mark>.[2] He was the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a full term 
        in the office. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the <b>Bharatiya Janata Party</b>. He was a 
        member of the <big>RSS</big>, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He was also a Hindi poet and a writer. <br><br><br>

He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, 
the lower house, and twice to the <mark>Rajya Sabha</mark>, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament from the Lucknow 
constituency, retiring from active politics in <b>2009</b> due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the
 Bharatiya Jana Sangh, of which he was president from <u>1968 to 1972</u>. The BJS merged with several other parties to form 
 the <mark>Janata Party</mark>, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs 
 in the cabinet of<mark> Prime Minister</mark>, <b>Morarji Desai</b>. He resigned in <b>1979</b>, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after.
  Former members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed the <b>Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980</b>, with Vajpayee its first president.

During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear <u>tests in 1998</u>. Vajpayee sought to improve 
diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. After the <mark>1999</mark>
 <mark>Kargil War with Pakistan</mark>, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez Musharraf, inviting him to 
 India for a summit at Agra. <b>Vajpayee's government</b> introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, including encouraging
  the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, encouraging research and development and privatisation of some
   government owned corporations.[5] During his tenure, India's security was threatened by a number of violent incidents including <mark>2001</mark> 
   Indian Parliament attack and <b>2002 Gujarat</b> riots which ultimately caused his defeat in <b>2004 general election</b>.

Vajpayee was conferred with the <i>Padma Vibhushan</i> in <b>1992</b>, India's second highest civilian award by the Government of India. The administration 
of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that <b>Vajpayee's birthday</b>, <b>25 December</b> would be marked as <big> Good Governance</big> Day. In 2015, he was honoured <mark>India's</mark>
 highest <u>civilian honour - Bharat Ratna</u>, by the then President of India, <b>Pranab Mukherjee</b>. He died in <b>2018</b> due to age-related illness.

    <p>
        <b>Narendra Damodardas</b> Modi[a] <mark>(born 17 September 1950)</mark> is an Indian politician serving as the current <big>prime minister</big> of India since 26 May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of <b>Gujarat from 2001 to 2014</b> and is the <big>Member of Parliament</big> (MP) for <u> Varanasi</u>. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the <b>Gujarat from 2001 to 2014</b>, a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.

Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a <big>full-time</big> worker for the <b>RSS in Gujarat</b> in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in <b>1998. In 2001</b>, Modi was appointed 
Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over <b>1,000</b> people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.

In the <b>2014</b> Indian general election, <mark>Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority</mark>, the first for a party since <b>healthcare, education, and social-welfare</b>. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending on <u>healthcare, education, and social-welfare</u> programmes. Modi began a <u>high-profile</u> sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed, but the action had nationalist appeal.<b> Modi's </b> party won the <b>2019</b> general election which followed. In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the <b>2020</b> Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs. Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw <big>India's</big> response to the <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates,
 4.7 million Indians died. In the <b>2024 </b>general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.

Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression. As <b>prime minister</b>, he has received consistently high approval ratings. Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]
